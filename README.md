# Dumb DB

A database implementation exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and software engineering.

## Purpose

Dumb DB emerged from a fundamental question: Can AI tools meaningfully assist in building complex systems? Rather than treating AI as a mere coding assistant, we're exploring its potential as a primary architect and implementer of sophisticated software.

### Core Philosophy

- **AI-Driven Development**: This isn't just about AI generating code. It's about understanding how AI reasons about system design, handles trade-offs, and implements theoretical concepts.
- **Learning Through Building**: While building a database from scratch isn't practical for most use cases, the process offers deep insights into both database internals and AI capabilities.
- **Tool Integration Study**: By combining Cursor, ChatGPT, and Perplexity, we're examining how different AI tools can complement each other in complex software engineering tasks.
- **Theory to Implementation**: Bridging the gap between academic knowledge and practical implementation, with AI as the translator.

### Why This Matters

The true value of this project lies not in its end product, but in what it teaches us about:

- The current capabilities and limitations of AI in software engineering.
- How AI tools can make complex computer science concepts more accessible.
- The potential for AI to transform how we teach and learn system design.
- The future of human-AI collaboration in software development.

## Technical Implementation

### On Using TypeScript and Node.js

Our choice of TypeScript and Node.js was deliberate, despite their limitations for database implementation. This decision embodies an important trade-off between theoretical purity and practical learning value.

1. **Performance Considerations**:

   - The garbage collector introduces non-deterministic pauses.
   - Single-threaded architecture limits concurrent operations.
   - Limited control over memory management.

2. **System Constraints**:

   - Restricted access to low-level system operations.
   - Suboptimal I/O performance characteristics.
   - Abstract memory model.

3. **Educational Benefits**:
   - Accessible syntax and semantics.
   - Rich development tooling.
   - Familiar environment for modern developers.
   - Clear demonstration of core concepts.

## Educational Context

This project can serve as a bridge between theoretical database concepts and practical implementation, particularly valuable for:

### Academic Integration

- MIT 6.830/6.814: Database Systems
- Stanford CS 346: Database System Implementation
- Undergraduate DBMS courses focusing on implementation

### Learning Focus

- Database internals and architecture.
- AI-assisted system design.
- Modern software engineering practices.
- Practical implementation of theoretical concepts.
