# Dumb DB 🗄️

A database engine written entirely by AI with minimal human intervention. Yes, you read that right! 🤖

## Overview 🌟

Dumb DB is an experimental project where we let AI do the heavy lifting in building a database system. Think of it as a "what if?" experiment - what if we let artificial intelligence tackle one of computer science's most complex challenges? 🤔

### Key Aspects 🎯

- **AI-First Development** 🧠: Nearly all code is generated and structured by AI tools, with humans just being "project managers"
- **Educational Exploration** 📚: Turning boring database theory into actual working code (with AI doing the hard parts!)
- **AI Tool Stack Study** 🛠️: Testing out the dream team of Cursor + ChatGPT + Perplexity for software engineering
- **Theory to Practice** 🔄: Taking study materials from "meh" to "yeah!" using AI tools

### Why Build a Database with AI? 🤷

Let's be honest - most developers won't (and shouldn't) build a database from scratch. But what if AI could help you do it anyway? That's what we're exploring here!

- Makes scary database concepts less intimidating 😌
- Shows how AI can be your coding buddy 🤝
- Perfect for learning without the headaches 🎓
- Proves that complex projects can be fun with AI help 🎮

## Technical Considerations 🔧

### Why TypeScript and Node.js?

We're building a database in TypeScript and Node.js because... why not? 😅
(Okay, there are actually some good reasons to NOT do this, but we're here to learn!)

1. **Performance Constraints** ⚠️:

   - Node.js's garbage collector likes to take surprise coffee breaks ☕
   - Single-threaded nature (one thing at a time, please!)
   - Memory management is more "suggestions" than "control"

2. **System Limitations** 🚧:

   - Can't talk to the hardware as directly as C/C++
   - File I/O is more "casual walk" than "sprint"
   - Memory manipulation is more abstract

3. **Why Use Them Anyway?** 💡:
   - Friendly syntax that won't make your eyes bleed
   - Amazing tools for debugging when things go wrong
   - Perfect for learning and experimenting
   - Because we can! 🎉

## Educational Applications 🎓

Want to spice up your computer science education? Here's where Dumb DB fits in:

### Relevant Courses 📚

- **MIT 6.830/6.814**: Database Systems
- **Stanford CS 346**: Database System Implementation
- **General DBMS Courses**: Perfect for that "implement a database" assignment!

### Learning Opportunities 🌱

- Peek under the database hood without getting too dirty
- See AI-assisted development in action
- Practice modern software engineering (with AI superpowers)
- Turn theory into working code (mostly written by robots!)

## Getting Started 🚀
